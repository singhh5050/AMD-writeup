# Matrix Multiplication Performance Analysis: AMD GPU vs CPU

## Overview

This document presents a detailed analysis of matrix multiplication performance comparing CPU implementation against three GPU implementations using AMD's HIP framework:
1. Naive GPU Implementation
2. Tiled GPU Implementation with Shared Memory
3. Optimized GPU Implementation with Loop Unrolling and Register Blocking

## Implementation Details

### CPU Implementation
- Standard triple-nested loop implementation
- Row-major memory access pattern
- No explicit vectorization or parallelization

### Naive GPU Implementation
- Direct mapping of matrix multiplication to GPU threads
- Each thread computes one element of the output matrix
- Uses only global memory access
- Simple but memory-intensive approach

### Tiled GPU Implementation
- Uses shared memory to reduce global memory access
- Tiles the input matrices for better cache utilization
- Requires thread synchronization within thread blocks
- Improved memory access pattern

### Optimized GPU Implementation
- Builds upon the tiled implementation
- Incorporates loop unrolling (4x unroll factor)
- Uses register blocking for accumulation
- Optimized thread block dimensions
- Further reduced memory access overhead

## Note on Execution Environment
This codebase demonstrates the implementation of matrix multiplication using AMD's HIP framework, showing the progression from naive to optimized implementations. While the code is complete and properly structured, execution requires:
- Linux operating system
- AMD GPU hardware
- ROCm/HIP toolkit installation

The code structure and optimization techniques mirror those used in CUDA, but adapted for AMD's architecture using HIP, demonstrating the key differences in:
- Memory management (`hipMalloc` vs `cudaMalloc`)
- Kernel launch syntax (`hipLaunchKernelGGL` vs CUDA's `<<<>>>`)
- Thread indexing (`hipThreadIdx` vs `threadIdx`)
